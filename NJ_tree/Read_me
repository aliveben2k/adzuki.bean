This pipeline is used to run on a PBS pro or Slurm server. It can create necessary scripts to send jobs.
If you wish to run it in a local machine, please use the option "-local".

Before doing the analysis, please make sure that you have check the following things:
check if “qsub_subroutine.pl” is in the $HOME/softwares folder.
check if “qsub_status.pl” is in the $HOME/softwares folder.
check if you have set the path to $HOME/softwares folder.

Please execute "vcf2phylo_qsub.pl" for NJ tree file.
Other files are required for vcf2phylo_qsub.pl

**This is a server script, if you want to run in the local machine, please use -local option.

Usage:
perl vcf2phylo.pl -i INPUT_FILE.vcf(.gz) -o OUTPUT_PREFIX_NAME [-pop POPULATION_INFO_FILE] [-mem] [-local] [-exc]

-i: vcf file
-o: output path with filename without extension such as .txt
-pop: (optional) population information, separated by tab, with/without header line (better without header line). If -pop is used, the phylogenetic tree will be generated based on “population level” instead of “individual level”.
	format: ID	pupulation
-mem: memory used for the job (in GB)
-local: run the pipeline locally
-exc: send the job for execution

*** R library "ape" is required. Please make sure you have this package before execution.
