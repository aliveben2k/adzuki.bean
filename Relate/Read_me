Pipeline of Relate software

The original software information can be found here:
https://myersgroup.github.io/relate/index.html

This pipeline optimized the original software for more simple usage.

To do the analysis, first you need to prepare files:
VCF file(s). It is better to use multiple vcfs that every vcf contains only one contig/chromosome.
A poplabels file. Please see “K7_07_poplabels.txt” for format.
A genetic map file. Please see “rmap_all.txt” for format example.
A reference fasta file. This is the genome sequence of the species that you made for the vcf file(s).
[Optional] A mask file. This is the same as the reference fasta file, but the mask regions are replaced by “N”.
For self-pollinating plant data, please use -self argument. Otherwise, you need to prepare synthetic F1 for running.
If you prefer to use synthetic F1 for self-pollinating plant data, please use -syn argument, and prepare a synthetic list file. (see “syn_F1_list.txt” for format.)

**IMPORTANT
When choosing the type of data using -syn/-self/-hap, please only use one of them. If you don’t use any of these, it will assume that your data is normal diploid data.
When -syn is set, -pop cannot be set. Otherwise, please set -pop.

Steps:
Run Relate_direct.pl script
nohup perl Relate_6_direct_5.pl -vcf VCF_FILE -pop POPULATION_LABEL_FILE -map RECOMB_MAP_FILE -al ANCESTOR_ID_LIST [-am ANC/MUT_FOLDER_PATH] [-hap] [-o OUTPUT_PATH] [-mask MASK_FILE] [-bins LOWER,UPPER,STEPSIZE] [-rm REMOVE_SAMPLE_ID_FILE] [-pre PREFIX] [-rr] [-coal COAL_FILE] [-dps] [-clues] [-tvs] [-bp CHR:POS-POS] [-ns INT] [-tco INT] [-pf FLOAT] [-d FLOAT] [-cp COLOR_PALETTE] [-m VALUE] [-n VALUE] [-spl VALUE] [-popi POP_NAMES] [-year VALUE] [-rp all|clues] [-cb FILE] [-rc INT] [--force] [-ow] [-sn SERIAL_NUMBER] [-exc] [-h]
 > LOGFILE 2>&1 &
-r: Reference fasta file [split_fasta.pl is required]
-vcf: vcf files, can point to a multi-contig vcf or a folder containing multiple vcfs with one chromosome/contig per vcf.
-pop: a poplabels file.
-o: output path, default: working folder
-am: If you already have *.anc and *.mut files, just indicate the folder path of these files by this argument.
-hap: If the data is haploid (or self-pollinated species), please use this argument.
-mask: a genome mask file [split_gmap.pl is required]
-rm: A list file. Remove sample from the analysis, one sample ID per line
-pre: prefix of the chromosome/contig name. If you only want to process chromosomes/contigs beginning with a certain name, you can use this argument. (eg. “Chr”, then chloroplast and mitochondria might be excluded)
This is case sensitive.
-rr: re-run main Relate program to generate new *.anc and *.mut files without re-running vcf to *.haps and *.sample process.
-coal: if you have *.coal file, you can use this argument
-bins: set boundary of the year for estimating effective population sizes
-dps: detect positive selection function (model)
-ci: file path and file name without extension for sample branch lengths used in CLUES
-bp: region of interests (chromosome_name:start_position-end_position)
-ns: Number of times branch lengths are sampled for -ci. Integer >= 1, Default: 5
-m: mutation rate per base per generation. Default: 1e-8
-n: effective size. Default: 30000
-popi: population of interest. This argument can specify populations that you want to do analysis. multiple populations as a group could be indicated by [population_1,population_2]. Multiple independent runs can be indicated by comma as population_1,population2.You can combine these two functions as [population_1,population_2],population_3
The first run will be population_1+population_2, and the second run will be population_3.
-clues: do sample branch lengths (CLUES, model)[need an additional CLUES software]
-tco: generation boundary of sample branch lengths (CLUES)
-pf: popFreq argument in CLUES plotting function.
-d: dom argument in CLUES plotting function.
-cp: color series for CLUES plotting.
-cb: set boundary of the year for CLUES’ plotting
-rp: re-plot data. possible values: all,clues
-tvs: Calculate TreeViewSamples for SNP ages.
-rc: Repeat runs. (for CLUES and TreeViewSamples)
--force: when -rc > 1000, please use this option for force run.
-cf: output format for Sample branch lengths function. possible values: “a” or “b”. For CLUES, the default value is “b”. For TreeViewSamples, the default value is “a”.
-year: years per generation. Default: 1
-spl: smoothing genetic map by spline function. Please indicate the level of smoothing (integer value. Default = 25, if this argument is used.)
-ow: over-write all output files
-sn: serial number. If you want to process the analysis using previous generated files, just set the –sn to the same serial number used for the previous run.
-exc: send the job to run
-h: help
** I suggest you don’t use all model functions at the first time unless you are familiar with the scripts.
