Before doing the analysis, please make sure that you have check the following things:

check if “qsub_subroutine.pl” and “qsub_status.pl” are in the $HOME/softwares folder.
check if you have set the path to $HOME/softwares folder.
make sure that “export create_job=/$HOME/softwares/qsub_subroutine.pl”, “export create_job=/$HOME/softwares/qsub_status.pl”, and “export plink=/[path to plink file]/[plink executable file name]” is in ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile. If it doesn’t, please add it. 
plink software: https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/
IMPORTANT: ADMIXTURE doesn’t allow chromosome names other than integers in vcf. Please rename the chromosomes if they are not integers.

(1) admixture_qsub.pl

Usage: perl admixture_qsub.pl -vcf|-bed VCF_FILE|BED_FILE -k INT [-sn SN][-no_prune][-mem INT][-local][-exc][-h\|--help]

-vcf: vcf_file
-bed: bed_file
(one of the above file type is acceptable, please don't use both type of files as an input)
-k: [1-30] it defines how many K values should be tested.
-sn: serial number (optional)
-no_prune: by default, the prune option is on, which means it will break the potential linkage of the SNPs. You can turn off this option by this argument.
-mem: change memory to use. Should be an integer.
-local: run the script locally. (instead of on the server)
-h: help

**This script needs to be run on the server.
**If you use a vcf file as an input, background running (nohup) is highly recommended, or don't turn off the running program.
**possible pitfalls:
If you got “Error: Out of memory.  The --memory flag may be helpful.” Please modify line 4 of admixture_qsub.pl to $plink = ‘plink64’, and make sure you have installed the 64-bit version of plink software and named the excusable file as “plink64”; It will use 64-bit plink program instead of 32-bit plink program. It might solve the problem.
If you got “Invalid chromosome code!  Use integers.” Please rename your chromosome name with integers only in the vcf. You can do it by “bcftools annotate --rename-chrs map_file vcf_file” function. (map_file: with "old_name new_name" pairs separated by space, each pair in separated lines)

(2) sort_admixture_pca.pl

Usage: perl $create_job -cj_exc [-cj_env /path/to/your/conda_R_environment] perl sort_admixture_pca.pl -vcf A_VCF_FILE -q A_Q_FILE -l A_SAMILE_INFO_FILE [-mtx MATRIX_FILE] [-reorder] [-m RATIO]
#If you have run the NJ_tree pipeline (suggest to do this first, the step 3 also needs files from this pipeline). You can supply *.mtx file using option -mtx. 
NJ_tree pipeline: Lee_lab\Computation_related\Pipelines_by_Ben\admixture_&_NJ_tree\NJ_tree
-vcf: vcf_file
-q: *.Q file generated from admixture program (or admixture_qsub.pl)
-l: list file (please see "sample_info.txt" as a referencif "type" or "country" columns are not available, please type "e format), NA" instead.
-reorder: If you want to order your samples by the user-defined order, please use this option, the sample order will be the same with the list file indicated by -l option.
-m: ratio, this defines the filtering threshold to assign groups based on admixture result. Possible values: 0-1. default: no

Output files:
PCA_K*_table.rda (R data file that can be used for plotting)
PCA_analysis.pdf (bar plot with PC1, PC2,...,PC20)
PCA_K*.pdf (PCA plot)
PCA_K*_table.txt (text file for PCA plot)
sorted_[*.Q file name] (sorted *.Q file with groups and sample name)
admixture_K*.pdf (admixture plot)

**This script can be run on a local machine.
IMPORTANT: pca_plot_v3.R and admixture_plot.R are required in the same folder. If you do not supply the *.mtx file, vcf2table_missingNA.pl and Calculate_pairwise_dist_simple_mo.R are also required.
**R packages "reshape2", "ggplot2", "tidyverse", “ape” are required.

(3) modify_nex.pl (optional)

Usage: perl $create_job -cj_exc perl modify_nex.pl NEX_LABEL_LIST

Output files:
iTOL_styles_PCA_K*_table.txt (iTOL branch color file)
colored_K*_tree.nex (NEXUS file with colored labeling for FigTree)

This file will find the *.nex files, and generate color-defined *.nex file for FigTree and color files for iTOL website.
**This script can be run on a local machine.
** PCA_K*_table.txt files generated from "sort_admixture_pca.pl" are required.
** *.nex files are generated from the NJ_tree pipeline. Please run NJ_tree before running step 3.
** Please see “nex_list.txt” for the format of NEX_LABEL_LIST
**The first text before “_” should be exactly the same with your original labels.
